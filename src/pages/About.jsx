                computer systems and a keen interest in building innovative and impactful solutions. 
                I'm a proud graduate of the British Columbia Institute of Technology's Computer Systems 
                Technology program, where I learned the majority of my skills in software development, problem-solving, 
                and teamwork.

                to enterprise application development, always striving to deliver clean, efficient, and user-friendly 
                solutions. My expertise includes modern web technologies, full-stack development, and 
                a commitment to continuous learning in this ever-evolving field.

                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, learning new life skills. I do enjoy
                a good story to read.
